# Advisor status — M2 final lap (updated 2026-07-25)

Read docs/roles/ADVISOR.md, then docs/roles/ADVISOR-CONTEXT.md (full memory; this file is the
immediate resume queue). Worktree: `C:\Users\charge\Documents\GitHub\Citadel\citadel-advisor`.
Verify every agent report against the repo/CI logs before endorsing — this milestone every
cross-review surfaced something green CI missed.

## Resume queue, in order

M2's two build PRs are **merged and green on main**. What remains is one unbuilt component, the
exit AC, and the checkpoint.

1. **Sol: local encrypted client store.** ADR first, then build. This is the last unbuilt piece
   of M2 scope (PLAN.md §9 names "local encrypted SQLite store") and it was on nobody's
   assignment until 2026-07-25. It is not optional: M2's acceptance criterion says "device
   compromise simulation shows past messages unreadable (delete state, verify FS)," and with
   `Provider = OpenMlsRustCrypto` all MLS state is in-memory, so there is no persisted state to
   delete and the forward-secrecy half of the gate cannot be tested honestly. The ADR comes
   first because `README.md` already commits to "SQLite, encrypted, key in the OS keychain" and
   nobody ratified that; key handling here touches INV-2. K3 design-reviews, charge accepts.
2. **K3: the M2 exit AC.** F2 + F4 across 3 clients on the live stack, no-plaintext scan on the
   delivery tables, `device_compromise_past_messages_unreadable_fs`, `pcs_recover_after_update`,
   and `adversarial_ds_swapped_keypackage_rejected`. The last two were blocked on the
   citadel-core work and are now unblocked. The FS test depends on item 1 landing.
3. **Integration checkpoint**, then charge declares M2. All lanes pass the multi-client harness
   together before anyone starts M3.
4. ADR-0006 follow-ups A-D remain binding, tracked, not started (A role isolation + bootstrap,
   B startup min-version, C risk-classification enforcement, D remaining probes).

Deliberately NOT started: Grok's real-core desktop wiring. It is genuinely unblocked now that
citadel-core is on main, and it is M3 scope, so the integration checkpoint holds it. Being
unblocked is not the same as being in scope.

## Lane assignment rationale (2026-07-25)

Assignments were checked against current published model strengths rather than left on
ownership alone; both landed where ownership already put them, which is a result, not a
formality. K3 leads SWE Marathon (42.0, ahead of Sol 39.0, Opus 4.8 40.0, Fable 5 35.0), the
benchmark measuring sustained multi-step reasoning over extended codebases, and its documented
profile is iterating against logs, tests, and runtime feedback. That is the exit AC exactly, and
at $3/$15 per M tokens with cache discounts it is also the cheapest lane for the most
context-heavy work left. Sol leads the coding-agent indexes and writes tighter code, which suits
a focused component behind a real security boundary.

Two operational constraints that follow from the models, not from preference:

- **K3 is documented as over-proactive when boundaries are ambiguous** (Moonshot recommends
  explicit behavioral limits). This is why `PLAN-KIMI-K3.md` makes K3 restate six Scope
  Discipline Rules verbatim. Every K3 tasking must name its boundary explicitly or K3 drifts
  into adjacent fixes.
- **Sol advertises ~1M context but is capped near 272K in the Codex CLI harness.** Now that
  citadel-core is substantial, keep its handoffs lean rather than loading whole crates.

No roster swap was made. Fable 5 has the strongest published scorecard and PLAN-CORE.md
authorizes paying premium for this seat, but the Sol/Fable margins sit inside harness noise, a
mid-milestone swap costs a full context reload, and Sol is on its best work here. The decisive
argument: nothing this project has lost time to was a capability gap. Every real defect this
milestone was caught by cross-review and verification discipline, which is a process property.
A better model would not have caught the one-sided INV-4 check; K3 reading the code did.

## State

- main `ce73cb9`. M1 closed and declared. M2 NOT closed. ADRs 0001-0006 all ACCEPTED
  (0006 + Amendment 1 = `search_path = public, pg_temp`).
- Zero open PRs. Remote is `main` only. Merged 2026-07-25: **#47** `9a74d94` (citadel-core:
  initiator KT checks + staged-commit processing), **#39** `33fcfe9` (delivery-service message
  path + WS gateway + ADR-0006 migration CORE), **#46** `ce73cb9` (repo cleanup).
- Both merge runs fully green on main, all seven jobs, log-verified rather than badge-read. The
  canary scan on `33fcfe9` reported `control_db_found: true` / `control_log_found: true`, so
  "clean" means the scanner proved it can find planted canaries first.
- **Process debt from this session, stated plainly:** #47 and #39 were merged on charge's
  instruction WITHOUT the delta re-reviews the advisor had recommended. The advisor verified
  both fixes line by line against source, but the advisor also wrote the review directives, so
  the independent second look did not happen. Recommended remedy, still open: have Sol and K3
  run their delta reviews against the merged commits, with anything found becoming a follow-up
  PR. Also not independently reproduced: K3's claim that each new migration test was
  mutation-checked to fail against the pre-fix code.
- Roster: Sol (GPT-5.6 Sol) core lane, K3 (Kimi K3) services/CI/harness, Grok (Grok 4.5) desktop,
  parked. The M3 churn rig moved Grok to K3 on 2026-07-25 (see AGENTS.md sequencing).
- Advisor self-corrections on record: (a) "#38 only blocked by deny.toml" was wrong, CI runs
  cargo-audit too; (b) my `search_path` ordering `public, pg_catalog, pg_temp` was weaker than
  Sol's accepted `public, pg_temp`; (c) I called the RUSTSEC-2023-0071 precedent a confabulation
  when it existed in `.cargo/audit.toml` all along.
- charge open calls, still open: **LICENSE file** (public repo, all-rights-reserved by default),
  gh-token tightening, Citadel trademark check.
- Sol's worktrees are owned by a separate Windows account (`CodexSandboxOffline`, the Codex
  sandbox user), so the advisor cannot inspect or clean them. Three finished ones remain on
  disk; only charge or Sol can remove them.

## Suppression config (both needed — cargo-audit AND cargo-deny run)

`deny.toml`: 8 ignores (#41). `.cargo/audit.toml`: 6 fatal ignores + pre-existing
RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (#42). All in the OpenMLS/hpke-rs libcrux chain, off the runtime crypto
path; revisit on an hpke-rs optional-dep fix.

## Repo cleanup 2026-07-24 (branch hygiene)

Remote branch count went 32 → 3 (`main`, plus the two live PR heads). Nothing unique was lost;
every deleted branch was either merged into main or superseded. SHAs recorded here so any
deletion is one `git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/<name>` away from reversal.

**Merged into main, deleted (23):**

**Not merged but superseded, deleted (5), with the reason each was safe:**

```
d15921d advisor/setup       stale 2026-07-17 wind-down; main's advisor.md and
                            ADVISOR-CONTEXT.md are a week newer. charge's own open call.
f9f58a6 k3/spike-deny-bans  its only file, ci/check_crypto_confinement.py, is already on main.
5d857da grok/status         2026-07-17 M0 handoff; main's docs/status/grok.md is 2026-07-20.
2b94f98 k3/status           2026-07-19 day-4 handoff; PR #39 carries a 2026-07-24 k3.md.
43b1f48 opus/status         2026-07-19 day-4 handoff that never merged, leaving main's
                            opus.md stranded at day 2. The SHA above is the salvage
                            point if anything from that handoff is ever wanted back.
```

**Structural defect this exposed, now fixed:** per-agent status files were being written on
side branches that were never merged, so `main` carried a day-2 Opus status for a week while
the real handoff sat unmerged. Status files are cold-start context; if they are not on `main`
they do not exist. Rule going forward: **a status file lands on `main` in the same PR as the
work it describes, or in a docs-only PR of its own.** Never on a branch that stays open.

Also cleaned locally on charge's machine: stale git worktrees (the finished
`citadel-sol-adr0006-search-path`, `citadel-sol-audit-parity`, `citadel-sol-pr39-review`
detached checkout, and `Citadel-opus` for the retired agent) and the matching local branches.
Live worktrees kept: `Citadel` (charge's primary), `citadel-advisor`, `citadel-k3`,
`citadel-grok`, `citadel-sol-pr38`.
